# napari eurasia meeting 2021-02-10

## Agenda

- Lorenzo: `vispy` and `cupy` with cuda + opengl interop is moving along: https://github.com/vispy/vispy/issues/1986. David Hoese is soon going to try implementing this in vispy, and we can help!

- Robert: some plugins developers (e.g: [napari-time-slicer](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-time-slicer)) want to access only the currently visualized data from a layer. A convenient access to this that is not private would be nice. #4002

- Tim-Oliver: persistent plugin config: where to put it? Is hijacking the napari config file ok?

- Robert: layer conversion between points and image/labels (`np.histogramdd` could do it), useful for example to jumpstart watershed with calculated centroids. Also, layer point generation starting from a feature table containing coordinates.Will open an issue soon!
