### Agenda

Exploring current design
* Andy's [notes on transforms](https://hackmd.io/QDjzjTIWS2CN0TdmdGlcOw)
* Eric's [notes on data](https://hackmd.io/@perlman/B1hxKO_TK)

Transforms
- [Grzegorz]: the way we work with vispy's scene graph causes scaling problems with the number of layers. Each layer gets a node; shallow tree.

Data to screen


Dims
- owned by viewer model
- which are the visible dims, not visible
- each layer in layerlist has extents
- looks at each extents and figures out max extents and step size
- interactions
    - qtviewer has a qt dims for slides etc
- tracked down which objects are connected via events. which classes set attributes of dims
- the current_step event connects to the ViewerModel's `_update_layers` which loops over the layers, calling `_slice_dims` on each.
> - [Layer._slice_dims](https://github.com/napari/napari/blob/dbf4158e801fa7a429de8ef1cdee73bf6d64c61e/napari/layers/base/base.py#L928-L984)
- There are also some comments on base Layer `_dims_displayed`, `_dims_not_displayed` and `_dims_displayed_order` that those are intended to be removed from the Layer class at some point

### Action Items

- Greg - diagram of events around Dims
- Eric - start trying to shove `Future[ndarray]` through. id pain points
