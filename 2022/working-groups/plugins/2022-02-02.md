### migration of plugin data (Grzegorz)

thoughts
- taking some inspiration from Django
- idea is to make a simple lib to support migrations

details
- version the data
- apply migration function
    - serially move through versions
    - mutating plain-old-dict
- some issues
    - renaming is easy
    - identifying with objects is hard
        - e.g. object moves/renames w/in or between packages
    - migrating enums
